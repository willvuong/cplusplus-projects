Workshop 3 Reflection
1) The size of the character string is 41 to store 40 characters. This is because the extra 1 space is to store the null 
\0 character, telling that the string is empty if nothing is store within it.
2) C++ allows declarations of two member functions as in C++ programming, overloading of functions is allowed. This means 
that the compiler in C++ knows to determine the function that is being called by matching the specified parameters of the 
function. So, if a function called someFunction had two defintions, one requiring one int and the other requires two ints, 
the compiler will know to call the second function if the call of someFunction had two int parameters.
3) I have learned the usage and importance of an empty state. An empty state is useful because it can easily get rid (more 
specifically: reset values) to 0 when necessary. The empty state was important and useful within this workshop as it 
required for some inputted values to be discarded because it did not fit within the specifications of being a valid SIN 
number.
