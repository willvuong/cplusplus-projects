Lab 1 Reflection
1. A namespace is a section within a code where it holds a grouping of its own unique identifiers or symbols specific to 
its own namespace; identifiers and symbols within a namespace only apply to its namespace that is is enclosed in. The 
purpose for a namespace is so that it can hold its own specific identifiers and symbols without conflict with other 
namespaces that may use the same name for it's identifiers and symbols. This is benificial as it will not lead to 
complications when compiling the code. 
2. Header files are needed as they contain declarations and defitions that can be used within multiple source files if 
needed. This is benificial because rather than constantly rewriting the necessary code, you can just include the header 
file within the source file by writing: #include <(header file.h)>, instead.
3. Header files are never compliled as they do not hold any significant value as far as coding for an actual running 
program. The purpose of a source file is to assist to a source file(s). If you were to compile a source file, nothing 
would happen because header files only contain decalarations and functions.
4. You should never include .cpp files into another file as it would mess up how the program runs. When you include a .cpp 
file into another file, the program cannot differentiate that of a source file between a header file. This will 
subsequently lead to redefinition errors as there may be several of the same defintions within two soruce files making the 
program unable to run correctly.
5. In this workshop I have learned the purpose of having multiple source and header files, and how to impliment them 
within a code. I have also learned the importance, benifits, and usage of namespaces.
