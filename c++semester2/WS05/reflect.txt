1. The operator+ should return a fraction object and not a reference because in this instance, this function is evaluating 
the sum of two specific objects (fractions) and reducing it into it's lowest form then returns it thus being a referenece 
to a fraction object. If you were to return the fraction object then it would return all the fractions within the object 
instead of one that you are trying to add two together with.
2. b when it changes from 1/3 to 1/2 when it goes through the += operator function. This happens as this function adds b 
and d and replaces the value of b with the sum of the two fractions.
3. The word Fraction was deleted several times from the overload operators.
4. I have learned how to overload an operator function and the purpose for it. Simply by specifying the word 'operator' 
followed by the desired operator allows for the specific operator to evaluate two objects. This is useful because as 
programmers we can evaluate several different things with several different cases with a set of values (object).
